### EvilPlays

Welcome to our new videgame catalog!. Feel free to login with your account (mocked for now) and add games to your gallery :). Once added you can add how many hours you invested in them!! Feel free to click on the hours invested to modify them and see how the number at the bottom grows.

You truly are a true gamer :).

### Current Development

- 3rd party API (https://rawg.io/apidocs) to retrieve games.
- Mocked Login (you can logout and login by clicking the button but will be developed in the future).
- Mocked Gallery (you can add games to your gallery by clicking the button but DB storage will be developed in the future).
- You can remove games from your gallery
- You can add hours to your games by clicking in the hours invested field.
- Search functionality. You can use the search bar to search games among the ones you have added to your gallery.
- Responsive behavior all across the SPA.

### Future Development (Phase 2)

- Backend
  - User Data saved in DB
  - My Games and everything related stored persistently
  - Games won't come from 3rd party API anymore.

### Future Development (Phase 3 - Depends on time)

 - Authentication and Authorization
